Description: An integrated mass cytometry data analysis pipeline that enables simultaneous illustration of cellular diversity and progression. Cytofkit2 integrates state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and in-house novel algorithms for data pre-processing, data visualization through linear or non-linear dimensionality reduction (UMAP/tSNE), cell clustering, automatic identification of cell subsets and inference of the relatedness between cell subsets.
