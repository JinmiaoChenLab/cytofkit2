\arguments{
\item{data}{Expression data matrix.}

\item{cluster}{A vector of cluster results for the data.}

\item{method}{Method for estimation of cell progression, isomap or diffusionmap.}

\item{distMethod}{Method for distance calculation, default is "euclidean", other choices like "manhattan", "cosine", "rankcor".}

\item{out_dim}{Number of transformed dimensions choosen for output.}

\item{clusterSampleMethod}{Cluster sampling method including \code{ceil}, \code{all}, \code{min}, \code{fixed}. The default option is 
\code{ceil}, up to a fixed number (specified by \code{fixedNum}) of cells are sampled without replacement from each cluster and combined for analysis.
\code{all}: all cells from each cluster are combined for analysis. 
\code{min}: The minimum number of cells among all clusters are sampled from cluster and combined for analysis. 
\code{fixed}: a fixed num (specified by fixedNum) of cells are sampled (with replacement when the total number of cell is less than fixedNum) from each cluster and combined for analysis.}

\item{clusterSampleSize}{The number of cells to be sampled from each cluster.}

\item{sampleSeed}{The seed for random down sample of the clusters.}
}
\value{
a list. Includes: sampleData, sampleCluster and progressionData.
}
\description{
Infer the progression based on the relationship of cell subsets estimated 
using ISOMAP or Diffusion map.
